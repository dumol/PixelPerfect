PixelPerfect
============

Pixel-perfect font rendering under Wayland and X.org.

Custom Fontconfig rules trying to cover all “web safe fonts” with aliases to
high-quality typefaces released under a free-software license.

Uses exquisitely-hinted fonts to enhance text rendering on low DPI devices at
small sizes, similarly to Windows pre-ClearType font rendering.
